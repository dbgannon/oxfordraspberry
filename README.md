# raspberry pi plus project oxford plus opencv

This repository contains the code described in the post http://esciencegroup.com/2016/01/21/raspberry-meets-project-oxford-iot-judging-a-book-by-its-cover/
There are five items here.  you will need the project oxford key,  a raspberry pi2, and a bing key.   all are easy to get.

## faces-with-oxford.py
This is the program used to read a jpg file and invoke the project oxford face recognizer.  it uses opencv to draw rectangles around the found faces illustrating gender and smile.

## words-on-while.py
This one uses opencv plus the OCR feature of project oxford to read words printed on a while piece of paper.

## book-cover.py
it uses the OCR feature to look at a book cover and generate a web page of bing results about the book.

## book-cover-opencv.py
this one is book-cover but it uses the words-on-white to better recognize "white books".

## web-server.py
this is just a basic webserver that serves up the pages generated by book-cover and book-cover-opencv.
